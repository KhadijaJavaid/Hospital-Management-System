# Hospital-Management-System
This program is a simple Hospital Patient Management System written in C++. It stores patient details using a Linked List, searches patients using a Binary Search Tree, and manages the waiting list with a Queue. The system uses a menu-driven interface and saves data to a file so records are not lost.
